Generate 20 multiple choice questions on the French Revolution in a json format compatible with this example code:

async function runAutomation(kahootTitle, kahootDescription) {
  console.log("Kahoot Automation Starting...");
  const questions = [
    {
      title: "What is the capital of France?",
      answers: ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
      correctIndex: 1
    },
    {
      title: "What is 2 + 2?",
      answers: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      correctIndex: 1
    },
    {
      title: "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
      answers: ["Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
      correctIndex: 1
    },
    {
      title: "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?",
      answers: ["Charles Dickens", "William Shakespeare", "Mark Twain", "Jane Austen"],
      correctIndex: 1
    },
    {
      title: "What is the largest ocean on Earth?",
      answers: ["Atlantic Ocean", "Indian Ocean", "Arctic Ocean", "Pacific Ocean"],
      correctIndex: 3
    }
  ];
  await waitForUserClick();
  await sleep(300);
  for (let i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
    console.log(`:: Creating question ${i + 1} of ${questions.length}...`);
    await buildQuestion(questions[i]);
    console.log(`[ OK ] Question ${i + 1} created!`);
    if (i < questions.length - 1) {
      await sleep(50);
      clickAddQuestion();
      await sleep(50);
      await selectQuizQuestionType();
      await sleep(100);
    }
  }
  console.log("[ DONE ] All questions created successfully!");
  await sleep(500);
  await setKahootTitleAndDescription(kahootTitle, kahootDescription);
  console.log("[ COMPLETE ] Kahoot automation finished!");
}
// You can customize the title and description by passing them as parameters:
runAutomation(
  "General Knowledge Quiz",
  "Test your knowledge with these fun questions about geography, math, science, literature, and more!"
);


Give me the full code with the new JSON questions list integrated in instead of these example question and come up with a title for the quiz to put in the kahootTitle parameter and a description to put in the kahootDescription parameter. Change nothing else.
